// TODO: Rewrite this in a more elegant way (but not today)
// I swear this worked at 2 AM
// Magic happens here ✨
// This is fine. Probably. Maybe.
// Why does this work? Nobody knows.
// Don’t touch this. You’ll regret it.
// Fix this before demo day!
// This function is older than me
// Placeholder for future regrets
// Here lies a bug… or a feature?
// Sorry future me
// This is not spaghetti code, it’s lasagna
// Definitely not copied from Stack Overflow
// Do not question this logic
// Oh, you’re reading this? Good luck
// Performance? What’s that?
// If it breaks, it’s your fault
// Ye who enter here, abandon all hope
// This took me 4 hours to write, don’t delete it
// Coffee-fueled miracle
// I had a plan… then I wrote this
// We don’t talk about this block
// TODO: Ask senior dev if this is legal
// Temporary fix (3 years ago)
// Code without bugs, just undocumented features
// Warning: contents may explode
// Who wrote this? Oh, it was me…
// Unoptimized but it works
// Why is this indented like this? Don’t ask
// Works on my machine™
// This comment is longer than the function
// Absolutely no idea what this does
// If you change this, you break everything
// Life is too short to write good code
// TODO: Add meaningful error handling
// I’m not proud of this
// We apologize for the mess
// This is a workaround, not a solution
// Refactor later... or never
// This is the hackiest hack to ever hack
// Call this at your own risk
// Debugging is fun, they said
// Can’t believe this actually runs
// It’s not broken, it’s just creatively engineered
// Leftover from the great refactor of 2023
// Best viewed with your eyes closed
// It works and that’s all that matters
// Mom said I’m a good coder
// Insert fancy algorithm here
// This part is haunted
// Running on pure vibes
// If true == false, just roll with it
// This logic is held together by duct tape
// End of the world handling
// Potentially important? Unsure
// Abandon logic all ye who enter here
// That was too easy. Suspiciously easy.
// Saving this for historical reasons
// This looks better than it performs
// Code ahead is slippery when wet
// Don’t blink or you’ll miss the bug
// This is why we can’t have nice things
// Warning: very opinionated code
// Copied from a dream I had
// Only compiles during full moons
// Hope is not a strategy, but it compiled!
// This breaks everything. So don’t touch it.
// Precariously balanced logic tower
// More duct tape than logic
// Quick fix before the deadline
// Commit message: “Please work”
// That’s a feature, not a bug. Promise.
// This code has seen things
// Fragile like my mental state
// DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT!
// My linter cried here
// That variable name is a cry for help
// TODO: Figure out why this doesn’t work
// Future me, forgive me
// Known issue: All of it
// Welcome to the jungle
// Because I said so, that’s why
// If it compiles, ship it!
// You're not paid enough to understand this
// This violates at least 3 design principles
// Sacrificed readability for runtime
// Written under extreme deadline pressure
// Yes, this is intentional. Probably.
// I was young and needed the commit
// This should be illegal in 12 countries
// This line is my legacy
// You’re still reading? Brave soul.
// If this breaks, run
// Abstraction? Never heard of it
// TODO: Document this (never did)
// This is where bugs breed
// I don’t get paid enough for this
// Wrote this while half-asleep
// Don’t worry, it’s safe-ish
// This is not the code you’re looking for
// Pushed directly to main. Deal with it.
// This worked before the update
// It’s ugly but it works
// The compiler doesn’t hate it, so it’s fine
// Last-minute miracle code
// Don’t test this too hard
